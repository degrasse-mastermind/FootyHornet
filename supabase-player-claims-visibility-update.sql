-- FootyHornet player verification visibility update
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL Editor if admins can approve a parent/player
-- request but the roster still shows that player as "Unverified Player."
--
-- What this fixes:
-- - Parent Trackers still see only their own verified player claims.
-- - Team admins/reviewer can see player claims for teams they manage.
-- - The app can correctly show "Verified Player" on admin roster cards.
