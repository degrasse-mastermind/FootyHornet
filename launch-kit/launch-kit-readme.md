## Important Launch Settings

In Supabase, the app's Site URL should be:

https://footyhornet.mybranford.com/

Redirect URLs should include:

https://footyhornet.mybranford.com/

Run the latest `supabase-schema.sql` before inviting a lot of users so multi-player cloud sync, team rosters, and player claims are current.
